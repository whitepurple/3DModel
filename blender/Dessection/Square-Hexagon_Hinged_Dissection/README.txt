# Summary

This is a keychain based on the Square-Hexagon hinged dissection shown here:  
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinged_dissection

The files provided are .scad files, which can be customized using Customizer and converted into .stl and .x3d files as needed. This Thing is unfinished - I attempted two different styles of hinges, but neither worked well for me. **dissection.cone-hinges.scad** is the latest stable version, but all three files are from May 2015 and I haven't revisited the project.

For anyone interested in improving this design, I recommend looking to the [Hinged Triangle-Square](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:263152) and trying to adapt their hinges. The .scad files I've provided are source code, and can be easily edited (by changing `addHinges()` and `myneighbors()`) to swap out the hinges.

Good luck!
